Website Resume
========

This is a simple project using a template from Udacity.

Some quick notes:
  JSON objects allow for editing of person details
  JSON objects are stored in resumeBuilder.js
  Jquery will sort through the JSON to build the website.
  If sections are missing in the JSON then the html will not show for those sections

Add ons:
  Take google maps and pull for github connection/linkedin connections
  Maps should show differently for each (tabs)
